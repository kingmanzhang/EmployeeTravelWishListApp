The aim of this project is to help manage a database for employees’ travel destination. To run the app, an employee wish list must be provided as a command line argument. The wish list follows the following format:

employee,destination1,destination2,...,destinationN

The app imports all the entries from the wish list and store them in an arraylist. The app allows adding new employees, adding new destinations to an employee, supports searching by employee name or a destination and also allows deletion of a particular employee or deletion of a destination from every employee’s list.
